                &emsp;Michael F. Buckley states, “The functions of design are deeply intertwined with our culture. However, our world is fundamentally transforming with the emergence of AI. This human-created technological revolution promises to enhance our lives, making them more convenient and efficient. Yet, this new way of life comes at the expense of exterminating many of the methods we currently depend upon to simplify our existence, including design as we know it,” meaning he believes AI is going to be the end of human designers, however, I disagree. Yes, Artificial Intelligence is emerging, now faster than ever, but AI is human created so there have to be designers to create it. Even if AI is created with machine learning, it still would not be able to harbor the creativity of a human.

                &emsp;AI learns directly from the person who created it or from other parts of the internet, so it is possible for it to understand how to design something based on picking the most popular colors and layouts thus seemingly eliminating the need for designers, however, I do not believe that it will ever have the capacity to create something entirely new. “AI is excellent at performing predictive analytics that can analyze large amounts of data to predict user behavior and preferences. This beneficial capability allows businesses to anticipate user needs and provide proactive solutions, enhancing the overall UX.” While I agree that AI has predictive capabilities, these will just come from what it has learned from other sources. Therefore, if it just uses references over and over again, which it does, eventually what it produces will become stale. Because of this, human designers are still going to be needed to keep adding to the AI’s “database” of different design techniques. Plus, just like pretty much everything else today, designs are trends. Styles and patterns come, go, and even come back all of the time, including design. While AI could predict future design trends, it isn’t guaranteed to be accurate nor will it be able to detect any new or surprising patterns. For example, if today, the length of a design isn’t as important, say for example, a painting being only one picture on one canvas, and in the future, the next trend is infinite zoom paintings, which are a painting that if you zoomed in at any point, it’d be a new painting which has something that can be zoomed in and so on. AI wouldn’t be able to predict it if it was never done before and would have to learn it from a human creator.

                &emsp;“This example shows that design plays a fundamental role in even the most mundane tasks. But what happens when AI replaces this entire process? If not already, users will go to their favorite AI application and ask the same question about green tea. But this time, they will not have to sift through dozens of designed websites. And instead of going to an online store to purchase green tea, they will just ask AI to recommend the best tea based on your given parameters. No more searching through hundreds of products to find the right one. In the process mentioned above, the only design experienced is that of the AI interface.” While this new way of shopping is highly likely going to happen, it’s not going to eliminate designers. First, there has to be tons of research done for the AI to recommend the best tea, which has to be done by humans. And if it makes a recommendation based on user parameters, there would still need to be different designs done by different humans in order to find the best one that fits the given criteria.

                &emsp;Throughout the article, Buckley tended to focus on why AI could replace designers without focusing on the how. Had he focused on how AI is created, I believe his perspective would have been very different.
