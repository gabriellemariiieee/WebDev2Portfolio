                <h2>Mission</h2>Everyone has nails but not everyone takes care of them (although you really should), so let us do it for you! Nail care that'll never damage with excellent prep followed by careful trimming and shaping (if requested) and a design that you'll always want to show off! We even do extensions if that's how you roll! And of course, we serve everyone because everyone deserves nail care!
                <br>
                <h2>About</h2>Getting her nails painted for as long as she can remember, Gabrielle has always had a passion of pretty nails. She began doing them herself as soon as she could and eventually experimented with different designs she saw on YouTube. In addition to designs, she also learned how to properly take of her nails so they can grow long and be strong. And yes, Pinterest is her best friend. Her motto is &quot;Nail care is self care&quot;!
